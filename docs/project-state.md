# Project State

## Product
- Product name: AI Agent for Automated Real Estate Sales, Leasing & Handover
- Primary markets: United States and Saudi Arabia
- Primary languages: English and Arabic
- Product truth lives in `docs/product-spec.md`
- Product positioning is now defined as a premium bilingual operating layer for sales, leasing, and handover operations

## Current Architecture
- Implemented architecture now includes a TypeScript monorepo foundation with `apps/web`
- Shared packages implemented in Phase 1A are `domain`, `i18n`, `ui`, and `testing`
- Root tooling now includes `pnpm` workspaces, `turbo`, TypeScript base config, ESLint, Vitest, and Playwright
- The web application is a Next.js App Router shell with EN and AR routes, RTL-aware layout switching, seeded fixtures, and placeholder Phase 1 surfaces
- `apps/api`, `apps/worker`, `contracts`, `database`, `workflows`, `integrations`, `analytics`, and `config` remain planned but unimplemented
- Durable memory is kept in `docs/project-state.md`
- Local working memory is kept in `docs/_local/current-session.md` and must remain uncommitted

## Non-Negotiable Rules
- Never store secrets in repository memory files
- Arabic must be treated as a first-class RTL experience
- Testing must matter from the beginning
- Avoid speculative implementation claims
- Code should be modular, typed, validated, and maintainable
- Keep commit messages under 140 characters

## Current Roadmap
- Phase 1A: Flagship Demo Core covering the bilingual web shell, seeded data, dashboard, inbox, conversation console, scheduling, document, handover, and manager views
- Phase 1B: Demo hardening for motion, state quality, responsive refinement, and stronger visual coverage
- Phase 2: functional alpha covering lead capture to qualification to visit scheduling to follow-up to manager review
- Phase 3: leasing and document workflows
- Phase 4: handover command center
- Phase 5: hardening and enterprise controls

## Completed Major Slices
- Bootstrapped durable repo memory and operating instructions
- Captured the initial product spec from the project brief
- Established local-only session memory via `docs/_local/`
- Upgraded `docs/product-spec.md` from the full v2 source specification into the authoritative product document
- Added planning docs for repo architecture, domain model, user journeys, roadmap, testing, i18n, and Intel Mac local development
- Implemented `Phase 1A: Flagship Demo Core`
- Added the monorepo workspace, shared package shells, Next.js web shell, bilingual routing, premium landing/dashboard/inbox/profile/conversation/scheduling/documents/handover/manager screens, and smoke-test coverage

## Important Decisions
- `docs/product-spec.md` is the durable product source of truth until implementation matures
- `docs/project-state.md` is the durable repository memory file
- `docs/_local/current-session.md` is local working memory and must be ignored by git
- The implementation architecture is a modern TypeScript monorepo
- Next.js is the planned web application framework
- Fastify is the planned application API framework
- BullMQ on Redis is the planned async workflow layer
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle is the planned persistence direction
- The first implementation phase is `Phase 1A: Flagship Demo Core`, which is web-first and fixture-backed
- Phase 1A intentionally uses seeded local fixtures instead of real persistence, live AI execution, or external providers

## Deferred / Not Yet Implemented
- Backend services
- Data model and persistence layer
- Authentication and authorization
- External integrations
- Dashboards and analytics
- Agent orchestration and workflow automation
- Real provider integrations
- Real AI execution and automation enforcement
- Phase 1B hardening work on motion, state refinement, and stronger visual coverage
- Real API, worker, and persistence-backed workflows from Phase 2 onward

## Risks / Watchouts
- Arabic UX can degrade quickly if RTL support is not designed from the foundation
- Omnichannel scope can sprawl without a disciplined first slice
- Auditability requirements can be missed if not designed early
- The premium product promise raises the bar for motion, state design, and visual quality from the first demo
- AI trust will fail quickly if escalation, approval, and inspection paths are not explicit
- Phase 1 must not drift into building real backend workflows prematurely
- The current shell must not be mistaken for functional workflow automation; Phase 2 is where persistence and real operations begin

## Standard Verification
- `git status --short`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm test:fast`
- `pnpm test:web-smoke`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm lint`
- `git check-ignore -v docs/_local/current-session.md`
